# Low-Cost Reference Type Shims For WASM Modules

A [reference type] (aka `externref` or `anyref`) is an opaque reference made available to
a WASM module by the host environment. Such references cannot be forged in the WASM code
and can be associated with arbitrary host data, thus making them a good alternative to
ad-hoc handles (e.g., numeric ones). References cannot be stored in WASM linear memory; they are
confined to the stack and tables with `externref` elements.

Rust does not support reference types natively; there is no way to produce an import / export
that has `externref` as an argument or a return type. [`wasm-bindgen`] patches WASM if
`externref`s are enabled. This library strives to accomplish the same goal for generic
low-level WASM ABIs (`wasm-bindgen` is specialized for browser hosts).

## Project overview

The project consists of the following crates:

- [`externref`](crates/lib): The library providing more typesafe `externref`s for Rust
- [`externref-macro`](crates/macro): Procedural macro for the library
- [`externref-cli`](crates/cli): CLI app for WASM transforms based on the library

## Project status ðŸš§

Experimental; it may be the case that the processor produces invalid WASM
in some corner cases (please report this as an issue if it does).
