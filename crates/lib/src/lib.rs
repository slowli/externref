//! Low-cost [reference type] shims for WASM modules.
//!
//! Reference type (aka `externref` or `anyref`) is an opaque reference made available to
//! a WASM module by the host environment. Such references cannot be forged in the WASM code
//! and can be associated with arbitrary host data, thus making them a good alternative to
//! ad-hoc handles (e.g., numeric ones). References cannot be stored in WASM linear memory;
//! they are confined to the stack and tables with `externref` elements.
//!
//! Rust does not support reference types natively; there is no way to produce an import / export
//! that has `externref` as an argument or a return type. [`wasm-bindgen`] patches WASM if
//! `externref`s are enabled. This library strives to accomplish the same goal for generic
//! low-level WASM ABIs (`wasm-bindgen` is specialized for browser hosts).
//!
//! # `externref` use cases
//!
//! Since `externref`s are completely opaque from the module perspective, the only way to use
//! them is to send an `externref` back to the host as an argument of an imported function.
//! (Depending on the function semantics, the call may or may not consume the `externref`
//! and may or may not modify the underlying data; this is not reflected
//! by the WASM function signature.) An `externref` cannot be dereferenced by the module,
//! thus, the module cannot directly access or modify the data behind the reference. Indeed,
//! the module cannot even be sure which kind of data is being referenced.
//!
//! It may seem that this limits `externref` utility significantly,
//! but `externref`s can still be useful, e.g. to model [capability-based security] tokens
//! or resource handles in the host environment. Another potential use case is encapsulating
//! complex data that would be impractical to transfer across the WASM API boundary
//! (especially if the data shape may evolve over time), and/or if interactions with data
//! must be restricted from the module side.
//!
//! [capability-based security]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! 1. Use [`Resource`]s as arguments / return results for imported and/or exported functions
//!    in a WASM module in place of `externref`s . Reference args (including mutable references)
//!    and the `Option<_>` wrapper are supported as well.
//! 2. Add the `#[externref]` proc macro on the imported / exported functions.
//! 3. Post-process the generated WASM module with the [`processor`].
//!
//! `Resource`s support primitive downcasting and upcasting with `Resource<()>` signalling
//! a generic resource. Downcasting is *unchecked*; it is up to the `Resource` users to
//! define a way to check the resource kind dynamically if necessary. One possible approach
//! for this is defining a WASM import `fn(&Resource<()>) -> Kind`, where `Kind` is the encoded
//! kind of the supplied resource, such as `i32`.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! The [`externref` macro](macro@externref) detects `Resource` args / return types
//! for imported and exported functions. All `Resource` args or return types are replaced
//! with `usize`s and a wrapper function is added that performs the necessary transform
//! from / to `usize`.
//! Additionally, a function signature describing where `Resource` args are located
//! is recorded in a WASM custom section.
//!
//! To handle `usize` (~`i32` in WASM) <-> `externref` conversions, managing resources is performed
//! using 3 function imports from a surrogate module:
//!
//! - Creating a `Resource` ("real" signature `fn(externref) -> usize`) stores a reference
//!   into an `externref` table and returns the table index. The index is what is actually
//!   stored within the `Resource`, meaning that `Resource`s can be easily placed on heap.
//! - Getting a reference from a `Resource` ("real" signature `fn(usize) -> externref`)
//!   is an indexing operation for the `externref` table.
//! - [`Resource::drop()`] ("real" signature `fn(usize)`) removes the reference from the table.
//!
//! Real `externref`s are patched back to the imported / exported functions
//! by the WASM module post-processor:
//!
//! - Imports from a surrogate module referenced by `Resource` methods are replaced
//!   with local WASM functions. Functions for getting an `externref` from the table
//!   and dropping an `externref` are more or less trivial. Storing an `externref` is less so;
//!   we don't want to excessively grow the `externref`s table, thus we search for null refs
//!   among its existing elements first, and only grow the table if all existing table elements are
//!   occupied.
//! - Patching changes function types, and as a result types of some locals.
//!   This is OK because the post-processor also changes the signatures of affected
//!   imported / exported functions. The success relies on the fact that
//!   a reference is only stored *immediately* after receiving it from the host;
//!   likewise, a reference is only obtained *immediately* before passing it to the host.
//!   `Resource`s can be dropped anywhere, but the corresponding `externref` removal function
//!   does not need its type changed.
//!

//! [`wasm-bindgen`]: https://crates.io/crates/wasm-bindgen
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! With debug info enabled, surrogate `usize`s may be spilled onto the shadow stack (part
//! of the WASM linear memory used by `rustc` / LLVM when the main WASM stack is insufficient).
//! This makes replacing these surrogates with `externref`s much harder (essentially, it'd require symbolic execution
//! of the affected function to find out which locals should be replaced with `externref`s). This behavior should be detected
//! by the [processor](processor), leading to "incorrectly placed externref guard" errors. Currently,
//! the only workaround is to [set debug info level](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#debug)
//! to `limited` or below for the compiled WASM module.

//! # Crate features
//!
//! ## `std`
//!
//! *(Off by default)*
//!
//! Enables `std`-specific features, like [`Error`](std::error::Error) implementations for error types.
//!
//! ## `processor`
//!
//! *(Off by default)*
//!
//! Enables WASM module processing via the [`processor`] module. Requires the `std` feature.
//!
//! ## `tracing`
//!
//! *(Off by default)*
//!
//! Enables tracing during [module processing](processor) with the [`tracing`] facade.
//! Tracing events / spans mostly use `INFO` and `DEBUG` levels.

//! # Examples
//!
//! Using the `#[externref]` macro and `Resource`s in WASM-targeting code:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use externref::{externref, Resource};
//!
//! // Two marker types for different resources.
//! pub struct Sender(());
//! pub struct Bytes(());
//!
//! #[externref]
//! #[link(wasm_import_module = "test")]
//! extern "C" {
//!     // This import will have signature `(externref, i32, i32) -> externref`
//!     // on host.

//!
//!     // `Option`s are used to deal with null references. This function will have
//!     // `(externref) -> i32` signature.
//!     fn message_len(bytes: Option<&Resource<Bytes>>) -> usize;
//!     // This one has `() -> externref` signature.
//!     fn last_sender() -> Option<Resource<Sender>>;
//! }
//!
//! // This export will have signature `(externref)` on host.
//! #[externref]
//! #[export_name = "test_export"]
//! pub extern "C" fn test_export(sender: Resource<Sender>) {
//!     let messages: Vec<_> = ["test", "42", "some other string"]
